   \caption{\textbf{Left panel:} The combination of a median (in the spectral direction) of two of our spectral cubes. The extraction regions marked in blue. The seeing is comparable to the 2MASS, enabling a direct comparison of 2MASS magnitudes and the spectra. Due to dithering, some of the stars are not on these cubes.\newline \textbf{Right~panel:} HST F550M image of the central of region of SN1604. We have marked the extraction regions with blue circles and the individual sources greater than $V=19.21$ ($10\lsun$ at the distance of the remnant taking the difference between F550M and V-filter into account) with red circles. There are a few extraction regions that contain more than one bright star .}
