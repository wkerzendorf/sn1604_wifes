   \caption{Overlay of RCW86 over a DSS background. The two thin circles show two possible locations for the remnant based on tracing the X-Ray contours. The large thick circle encompasses both and we suggest a sensible search area would be a third of that (small thick-lined dashed circle). However, a search on USNO-B revealed more than 2000 stars with R$<16$ (7~\lsun using the distance to the remnant and reddening)}
